=comingUP

==Developed By: Krista Calderon, Joe Marzullo, and Jamie Karlovich

comingUp is a platform specifically made for General Assembly's outcomes team.  As students, we were underwhelmed with the current system for posting our deliverables to Larry and Beth.  There were multiple forms to review on multiple applications which made it difficult to know if we had completed everything asked for.  We thought we could make it more intuitive for the students to find what they need as well as make it easier for Larry and Beth to get each students' information in one place.
